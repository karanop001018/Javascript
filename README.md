# My JavaScript Learning Journey

Hello there! This repository documents my journey of learning JavaScript from beginner to advanced level. I am committed to learning and practicing JavaScript on a daily basis, and this repository is a testament to that commitment.

## About

This repository contains exercises and projects that I have completed as part of my learning process. The exercises range from simple tasks to more complex problems, designed to test my understanding and application of JavaScript concepts.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Beginner/`: Contains exercises and projects that I worked on when I was starting out with JavaScript. These primarily cover basic concepts such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- `Intermediate/`: Contains exercises and projects that involve more complex concepts such as objects, arrays, DOM manipulation, and error handling.
- `Advanced/`: Contains exercises and projects that deal with advanced topics such as asynchronous programming, promises, AJAX, and working with APIs.
